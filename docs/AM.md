# Account Maintenance API

AccessOne AM APIs provide real-time access to our backend systems of record for inquiry and maintenance. These APIs are available for use by our wholesale and Full Service Processing ISO clients and are welcome to integrate these APIs within your own workflow and systems. APIs are available for merchant/equipment inquiry and maintenance.

## Merchant Inquiry

Real-time inquiry APIs will retrieve merchant attribute information directly against the backend systems of record. The APIs use a full REST/JSON implementation and all of the associated documentation is included directly in the API specifications. An API is available to retrieve all merchant attributes. There are also APIs to retrieve smaller subset of information (e.g. Location Chaining, Merchant Profile, Programs, Entitlements, Billing Attributes).

## Merchant Update

A real-time update API will allow for maintenance directly against the backend systems of record. The API uses a full REST/JSON implementation and all of the associated documentation is included directly in the API specifications. You can leverage this API in your workflow in order to keep your systems synchronized with the Fiserv processing platforms.
