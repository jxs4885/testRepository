# Getting Started

## Welcome to the AccessOne API Suite

AccessOne APIs are built on the foundation of REST. The APIs accept standard JSON requests and return JSON encoded responses while leveraging industry standard HTTP status codes for a seamless integration and provide real-time access to our backend systems of record for inquiry and maintenance, boarding as well as reporting. These APIs are available for use by our ISO clients and are welcome to integrate these APIs within your own workflow and systems.
