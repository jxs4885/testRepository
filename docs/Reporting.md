# Reporting API

AccessOne Reporting APIs provide access to our system for reporting. These APIs are available for use by our Retail, Wholesale and Full Service Processing ISO clients and are welcome to integrate these APIs within your own workflow and systems for a seamless integration. Interaction through our Reporting APIs provides the developer community the ability to retrieve transaction, chargeback, funding and settlement information in a simple and intuitive manner. You will find that access to itemized or summary data can be quickly initiated programmatically for statistical analysis purposes.

## Authorizations

Authorizations refers to the transactions as soon as they are received by the receiving end point. An authorization can either be Approved or Declined. There are many details associated with the transaction that will determine where the authorization is ultimately routed to.

## Settlement

Approved and eligible authorizations are sent over for settlement with the associations/issuers. The process is initiated the same day; however, the settlement process may take 1, 2 or more days.

## Funding

Funding activity denotes what was transferred into the merchant account, broken down by deposit and various fees. Funding reports are used in the reconciliation process to the merchant bank account. Any adjustments will be shown as deductions made from the merchant's total sales (chargebacks, fees, interchange charges, etc.)

## Chargebacks

The Disputes Overview provides an overview of Outstanding, Reversed, and Closed Chargebacks. Merchants can quickly see the total number of Open, Fulfilled, and Expired Chargebacks, as well as the total number of Chargebacks that are Open, Closed, and Reversed.

## Retrievals

While there are many reasons an issuing bank may send a retrieval request, the notification process can be very simple. The Retrievals selection will help you facilitate the process of retrieving and fulfilling sales draft requests. In some instances, unanswered retrieval requests can result in a chargeback being initiated by the issuing bank.
