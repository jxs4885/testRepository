# What is AccessOne

AccessOne is a powerful business management platform that offers
a single point of expedited entry for boarding, reporting and account maintenance 
and helps simplify complexity. It helps you manage and grow your Fiserv business and 
merchant portfolio.

It is available to our retail, wholesale and FSP partners.

The website can be customized with your company logo and color
scheme. Every time your merchants or sales agents log in to AccessOne, they will
be exposed to your logo, helping your business increase brand awareness and
name recognition.

&nbsp;

## Boarding

Our streamlined boarding solution allows you to board a merchant entirely through one submission.
The boarding experience will not only board the merchant on the processing back-end, but will
also establish the merchant on the authorization front-end. 

&nbsp;

## Reporting

Your business operations are centered on the need to manage transactional data. Critical reports are
vital for your business and the Reporting module gives you access to all of your merchant portfolio
data.

&nbsp;

## Account Maintenance

AccessOne delivers a Customer Relationship Management (CRM) system that gives you the
power to self-service your merchant account quickly and easily.

Note: The Account Maintenance API module is not available to Retail Partner clients.

&nbsp;

## Profitability Estimator

The merchant Profitability Estimator module provides daily, weekly, and monthly income and
expense reporting designed to show an estimate of the profitability of your merchant portfolio at the
merchant, batch or transaction level. This powerful tool will allow you to get an estimate of your
merchant profitability the day after the merchant settles a batch. Itâ€™s all the profitability information
you need to help you determine net profit so you can manage your merchant portfolio at peak
performance

&nbsp;

## Risk Management (Add-On)

The Risk Management module is designed as a fully interactive and customized tool for all merchant
service providers, large or small. Risk parameters can be set with predetermined default settings
or can be changed on an ad hoc basis to provide your company with greater risk management
control. The Risk Management system can be used to monitor and detect possible signs of
fraudulent activity, such as duplicate transactions, a high percentage of keyed transactions, or a high
percentage of declined authorizations.

Note: The Risk Management module is not available to Retail Partner clients
